/**
 * macOS-only: detect whether the user has a composition-based Input Method
 * Editor (IME) enabled, or one is currently selected.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   The CGEventTap-based stealth typing path captures keystrokes at the OS
 *   event-pipeline level — BEFORE the macOS Text Input System (TIS) routes
 *   them through the active input method. `CGEventKeyboardGetUnicodeString`
 *   honours the keyboard layout (US, AZERTY, dead keys), but it does NOT
 *   honour composition: pressing "z" with Simplified Pinyin selected still
 *   returns the literal "z", because pinyin composition happens at the
 *   NSTextInputClient layer one level above the tap. Auto-engaging the tap
 *   when the user clicks the chat input therefore breaks every CJK / IME
 *   user — they can only type Latin characters into the chat box.
 *
 * Cheap fallback: if any IME is present in the user's enabled input sources,
 * we skip auto-engaging the tap on click. The explicit activation hotkey
 * still works for users who deliberately opt into stealth typing.
 *
 * Detection mechanism:
 *   `defaults read com.apple.HIToolbox` returns the user's HIToolbox prefs.
 *   Each enabled input source carries `InputSourceKind` and `KeyboardLayout
 *   Name` keys; IMEs (Pinyin, Hangul, Kanji, Anthy, etc.) carry
 *   `InputSourceKind = "Keyboard Input Method"` and an ID prefixed with
 *   `com.apple.inputmethod.`. Plain layouts use `com.apple.keylayout.`.
 *
 *   We shell out once at startup (and on demand) and cache the boolean.
 *   `defaults` is a built-in macOS CLI; cost is ~10–30 ms per call.
