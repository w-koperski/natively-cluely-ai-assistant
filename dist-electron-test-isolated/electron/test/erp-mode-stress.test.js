    { ts: '0:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Hello, today we want to go through your process step by step. I would like to understand: how the process looks, who does each step, what systems and documents are used. It is also very important for me to know: what problems you have, what does not work well, where you do manual work. Please describe the real process, not the ideal one.' },
    { ts: '0:45', speaker: 'C', text: 'Sure. We are a manufacturing company. We start selling by receiving purchase orders from customers through email or our website. If we do not have the item in stock, we start the procurement process.' },
    { ts: '1:10', speaker: 'I', text: 'Do you use offers? What information do you need for a customer to submit an inquiry and offer?' },
    { ts: '1:35', speaker: 'C', text: 'We do not use formal offers. The customer sends an email or buys directly on the website. Our sales team then checks availability and confirms the order.' },
    // ── 2:00 Purchasing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '2:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'When you say procurement process — who starts it and what document is used?' },
    { ts: '2:25', speaker: 'C', text: 'The warehouse manager checks our stock. If we are below reorder point, he sends a purchase requisition to the purchasing department. That is an internal email with a PDF attachment listing the items.' },
    { ts: '2:50', speaker: 'I', text: 'What data is needed on that requisition?' },
    { ts: '3:15', speaker: 'C', text: 'Item number, quantity, preferred supplier, and the project code it belongs to. The project code is important because each department has its own budget.' },
    { ts: '3:40', speaker: 'I', text: 'Who approves the requisition? And how long does that take?' },
    { ts: '4:05', speaker: 'C', text: 'The purchasing manager approves it. Usually takes one day. But if the amount is over five thousand euros, our CFO needs to sign off as well. That can take three days.' },
    { ts: '4:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What happens if the supplier cannot fulfill the order?' },
    { ts: '4:55', speaker: 'C', text: 'The purchaser calls three suppliers to get quotes. This is done manually in Excel. We do not have a system for comparing offers automatically.' },
    { ts: '5:20', speaker: 'I', text: 'What can go wrong in this process?' },
    { ts: '5:45', speaker: 'C', text: 'Often the item numbers in the requisition do not match the supplier catalog. We have a manual cross-reference table in Excel that is outdated. Also, the project code sometimes gets entered wrong and the wrong department gets billed.' },
    // ── 6:30 Planning ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '6:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'Let us move to planning. How do you create your production plan?' },
    { ts: '7:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We use a spreadsheet. Every Monday, the production planner looks at confirmed orders and simulates capacity in Excel. He tries to balance machine load and labor hours.' },
    { ts: '7:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What data is needed for that simulation?' },
    { ts: '8:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Sales orders, machine capacity tables, shift schedules, and current work-in-progress. Some of this comes from our ERP, some from paper notes on the shop floor.' },
    { ts: '8:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'How often does the plan change after Monday?' },
    { ts: '9:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Every day. Urgent orders come in and we have to reshuffle. The planner spends two hours every morning just updating the spreadsheet.' },
    { ts: '9:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What is the biggest problem with this approach?' },
    { ts: '10:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We cannot see material availability in real time. We schedule a job and then discover the raw material is not in stock. Then we have to unschedule and reschedule. It happens three to four times per week.' },
    { ts: '10:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'Are there any approvals needed for the plan?' },
    { ts: '11:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'The production manager approves the weekly plan. He signs a printed version. We file it and it becomes part of the batch record for quality.' },
    // ── 12:00 Warehouse & Logistics ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '12:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Now let us talk about warehouse. How do you receive goods?' },
    { ts: '12:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The warehouse worker receives the delivery. He compares the delivery note to the purchase order in our system. Then he counts items and updates a handwritten log. Later he types the receipt into the ERP.' },
    { ts: '13:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Why is it handwritten first?' },
    { ts: '13:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'Internet is slow in the warehouse. The WiFi only works near the office. Also, the ERP is slow to respond so workers prefer to write first and input later when they have time.' },
    { ts: '14:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'What happens when the count does not match the delivery note?' },
    { ts: '14:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The worker calls the supplier and creates a discrepancy report. The report goes to purchasing by email. Purchasing then contacts the supplier for credit or replacement. This can take two weeks.' },
    { ts: '15:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you manage inventory accuracy?' },
    { ts: '15:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'We do a physical count once per month. We close the warehouse for a day and count everything. Last month we found forty-seven discrepancies. Most were under ten items but two were over five hundred euros.' },
    { ts: '16:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you handle putaway?' },
    { ts: '16:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The warehouse worker looks at the item label and decides the storage location based on a mental map. There is no system guiding him. Sometimes items end up in the wrong bin and we cannot find them for days.' },
    { ts: '17:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'What about shipping? How are outbound deliveries organized?' },
    { ts: '17:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The logistics team prints a picking list from the ERP. They walk through the warehouse and collect items. Then they pack and arrange shipment with our carrier. The carrier tracking number is typed into the ERP manually after pickup.' },
    // ── 18:30 Production ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '18:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'Let us cover production. How do you start a production order?' },
    { ts: '19:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'The production planner creates a production order in the ERP. He allocates materials, labor, and machine time. Then he releases it to the shop floor. But material allocation is only a reservation — it does not check if the material is physically available in the warehouse.' },
    { ts: '19:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What happens at the shop floor level?' },
    { ts: '20:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'The operator sees the order on a screen near his station. He confirms start and end times by scanning a barcode. The barcode system is connected to the ERP but only updates every thirty minutes due to batch processing.' },
    { ts: '20:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What can go wrong during production?' },
    { ts: '21:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Quality issues are the biggest problem. When a defect is found, the operator fills out a paper form and notifies the quality manager. The quality manager then decides whether to hold or release the batch. This decision is not recorded in the ERP — only in email.' },
    { ts: '21:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you handle scrap and rework?' },
    { ts: '22:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Scrap is recorded on the production order by the operator at the end of the shift. Rework requires a separate rework order which is created manually by the production planner. We do not have a standard process for rework — it depends on the product.' },
    { ts: '22:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What reports and KPIs do you use for production?' },
    { ts: '23:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We track OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) manually in Excel. We also track first-pass yield, scrap rate, and downtime per machine. The production manager reviews these every Friday in a meeting.' },
    // ── 24:00 Sales ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '24:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Let us discuss sales. How does an order get created?' },
    { ts: '24:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The sales team creates a sales order in the ERP from the customer email or phone call. They enter the customer number, item numbers, quantities, and requested delivery date. If the customer is new, they have to create the customer record first.' },
    { ts: '25:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'How long does order creation take?' },
    { ts: '25:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'For existing customers, about five minutes. For new customers, up to thirty minutes because we need to verify credit terms and add a new address. We do not have a self-service portal for customers to enter their own orders.' },
    { ts: '26:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you handle pricing?' },
    { ts: '26:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'Prices come from the price list in the ERP. For special campaigns or volume discounts, the sales manager approves a manual price override. This is done by email and the override code is entered in the order manually.' },
    { ts: '27:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'What happens after the order is confirmed?' },
    { ts: '27:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The order goes to warehouse for availability check. If stock is available, it is allocated. If not, a stockout alert goes to the purchasing manager. The customer receives an email update but it is not automatic — the sales rep sends it manually.' },
    { ts: '28:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you manage customer complaints?' },
    { ts: '28:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'Customer emails the support team. The support team forwards to the relevant department — quality, logistics, or sales. There is no ticket system. Resolution time varies from same day to two weeks depending on complexity.' },
    // ── 29:30 Projects ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '29:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'Let us move to projects. Do you manage any projects?' },
    { ts: '30:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Yes. We have a project management office for custom installations. Each project has a project code, work breakdown structure, and budget. We track labor hours against budget weekly.' },
    { ts: '30:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What system do you use for project tracking?' },
    { ts: '31:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We use a separate project management tool for planning and MS Project for schedules. Financial tracking is in the ERP with project cost centers. But the two systems do not talk to each other, so we do a manual reconciliation once per month.' },
    { ts: '31:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What data do you capture per project?' },
    { ts: '32:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Labor hours entered by each team member through a timesheet in the ERP. Material consumption from the production orders linked to the project. And vendor invoices matched manually against purchase orders.' },
    { ts: '32:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you handle scope changes?' },
    { ts: '33:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'The project manager sends an email to the client with a change request form. If the client approves, we update the budget in the ERP manually. There is no formal change order workflow in the system.' },
    { ts: '33:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What are the main pain points in project management?' },
    { ts: '34:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Timesheet entry is done at the end of the week by each team member. By then we have already lost visibility on daily progress. Also, forecast vs. actual cost comparison is only available after month-end close.' },
    // ── 35:00 Returns & Complaints ──────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '35:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you handle returns and complaints?' },
    { ts: '35:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The customer sends an email. The support team logs it in a shared Excel sheet. Then they investigate and respond. We do not have a formal returns authorization process. The warehouse receives the returned item and checks it against the original order.' },
    { ts: '36:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'What happens when a return is accepted?' },
    { ts: '36:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'We create a credit memo in the ERP. The credit memo needs approval from the finance manager. Then the customer gets a refund or replacement. The whole process takes about ten working days.' },
    { ts: '37:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you track complaint trends?' },
    { ts: '37:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'We do not have systematic tracking. The sales manager reviews complaints in the monthly meeting and decides on actions. There is no root cause analysis process. The same complaints come back every quarter.' },
    { ts: '38:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'What about quality complaints specifically?' },
    { ts: '38:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'Quality complaints go to the quality manager by email. He inspects the returned item and writes a report. If it is a supplier issue, we file a claim with the supplier. If it is our issue, we file an 8D report. Both are paper-based.' },
    // ── 39:30 Other Operational Processes ───────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '39:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What other operational processes do you have that we have not covered?' },
    { ts: '40:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We have a preventive maintenance process for our machines. The maintenance technician fills out a paper checklist after each maintenance activity. The data is not entered into any system, so we cannot analyze MTBF or MTBR easily.' },
    { ts: '40:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you handle equipment breakdowns?' },
    { ts: '41:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'The operator calls the maintenance technician. He fixes it and writes the repair details in a paper logbook. If the repair takes more than four hours, the production manager is notified to reschedule the job.' },
    { ts: '41:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What about quality control and inspection?' },
    { ts: '42:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We have incoming inspection for raw materials and output inspection for finished goods. The inspector fills out a paper form and enters results into the ERP manually at the end of the shift. For critical components, we retain inspection records for three years.' },
    { ts: '42:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'How do you manage supplier relationships?' },
    { ts: '43:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We have annual performance reviews with key suppliers. The purchaser collects data from various Excel sheets and creates a summary. We do not have a formal supplier scorecard system. The main KPIs are on-time delivery and quality reject rate.' },
    { ts: '43:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What about document control and compliance?' },
    { ts: '44:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We are ISO 9001 certified. Documents are controlled by the quality department. Approved documents are stored in a shared network drive with a version control table in Excel. When a document is updated, the quality manager sends an email to all affected employees.' },
    // ── 45:00 Integration Points ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '45:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Tell me about your integration points. Which systems exchange data with your ERP?' },
    { ts: '45:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'We have an interface with our carrier for shipment tracking. When the carrier picks up the order, they send an EDI message that updates the tracking number in the ERP. But if the carrier sends a status update, we do not receive it — we have to check their website manually.' },
    { ts: '46:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'What about financial integrations?' },
    { ts: '46:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The ERP is integrated with our accounting system. Invoices, credit memos, and payments are synchronized automatically. But the bank statement import is manual — someone downloads the CSV from the bank and uploads it to reconcile payments.' },
    { ts: '47:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Any other integrations?' },
    { ts: '47:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'We have a direct API connection with our main raw material supplier. They send advance shipping notices that create a pending receipt in our ERP. But the connection goes down at least once per month and we have to manually reinitiate the sync.' },
    // ── 48:30 Migration Needs ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '48:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What data would you need to migrate from your current system to a new ERP?' },
    { ts: '49:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We need to migrate open customer balances, vendor balances, and outstanding purchase orders. Also item master data with the old item numbers mapped to supplier catalog numbers. And the project cost center structure. We estimate about forty thousand master records and two years of open transactions.' },
    { ts: '49:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'How clean is your current data?' },
    { ts: '50:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Not very clean. We have duplicate customer records — about eight percent. Duplicate items — about twelve percent. And about fifteen percent of open orders have invalid project codes because the codes were changed and not updated in older orders.' },
    { ts: '50:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What data would you NOT migrate?' },
    { ts: '51:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We would not migrate closed transactions older than two years. Also, some legacy item numbers that have been inactive for over five years. And the paper-based quality records — those would stay in the physical archive.' },
    // ── 52:00 Approval & Decision Workflows ────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '52:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Walk me through your approval workflows. Which decisions require human approval?' },
    { ts: '52:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'Purchase orders over five thousand euros need CFO approval. Sales orders with more than ten percent discount need sales manager approval. Production orders for new products need engineering sign-off. And any credit memo over five hundred euros needs finance manager approval.' },
    { ts: '53:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'How are these approvals tracked?' },
    { ts: '53:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'By email. The approver replies with approved or rejected. There is no audit trail in the system. For the CFO approval, we print a PDF of the PO and get a handwritten signature, then scan it back. This is filed by the purchase order number.' },
    { ts: '54:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'What happens when an approval is rejected?' },
    { ts: '54:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'The requestor gets an email with the reason. They then have to modify the request and resubmit. For a CFO rejection, this can happen two to three times before approval because the budget year or project code was incorrect.' },
    // ── 55:30 System Needs & Improvement ────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '55:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What must improve in the new system?' },
    { ts: '56:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Real-time inventory visibility across all warehouses and locations. Automatic material availability check in the production plan. Supplier portal for price lists and lead times. Self-service customer portal for order status. Automated approval workflows with mobile notifications. And real-time project cost tracking against budget.' },
    { ts: '56:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What about reporting and KPIs?' },
    { ts: '57:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'We need dashboards for production efficiency, inventory turnover, on-time delivery, and supplier performance. These should be accessible from mobile devices. The current reports are all static and require someone to run them manually at the end of each week.' },
    { ts: '57:30', speaker: 'I', text: 'What are your biggest concerns about a new system implementation?' },
    { ts: '58:00', speaker: 'C', text: 'Data migration risk. We have had a bad experience with a previous ERP implementation where data was lost. We are also concerned about user adoption — our operators are not very tech-savvy. And we need the system to be stable before our peak season in September.' },
    // ── 59:00 Closing ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    { ts: '59:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Before we close, is there anything about your processes that I should know but did not ask?' },
    { ts: '59:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'We have a seasonal pattern — September to December is our peak. During that time, we run two shifts and hire temporary workers. The system must handle the volume increase without performance degradation. Also, our CFO requires a consolidated view of all operational KPIs every month, so any new system must support that.' },
    { ts: '60:00', speaker: 'I', text: 'Thank you. This has been very helpful. We will now compile the findings and prioritize the workshop sequence based on what you have shared.' },
    { ts: '60:30', speaker: 'C', text: 'Thank you. I appreciate the thorough approach. Please send me the summary of findings before the next workshop.' },

// ── Custom Mode Prompt (from Modes Manager UI) ───────────────────────────────
const ERP_CUSTOM_PROMPT = `ROLE:
You are a Senior ERP Implementation Analyst.
You need to understand processes for your client.
You have deep knowledge of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.
You help run discovery interviews for operational processes.

FOCUS AREAS (in this order):
1. Purchasing
2. Planning
3. Warehouse and logistics
4. Production
5. Sales
6. Projects
7. Returns and complaints
8. Other operational processes (not finance)

YOUR GOAL:
Understand the client's real processes — not just what they say, but how it really works.
Find: problems, documents, roles, data, exceptions, manual work, and system needs.

HOW YOU WORK:
- Always start by mapping all process areas
- Then suggest the best order for workshops
- Then go area by area
- After each area give a short summary

INTERVIEW STYLE — ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS:
- Ask exactly 2-3 short questions per turn — no more, no less
- Use B1 English only — simple words, short sentences
- Ask follow-up questions when answers are vague
- Never ask long multi-part questions
- Never focus on finance
- Stay on operational processes only

AFTER EVERY ANSWER YOU GIVE:
Write in English (B1) first — short and clear.
Then write the same in Polish directly below.
Always. No exceptions.

FOR EACH PROCESS AREA COLLECT:
- Who starts the process and when
- What document is used
- What data is needed
- What happens next
- What can go wrong
- How often it happens
- What is done manually
- What is outside the system
- What users find difficult
- What must improve in the new system
- Approvals and decisions
- Exceptions and workarounds
- Reports and KPIs needed
- Integration points
- Migration needs
