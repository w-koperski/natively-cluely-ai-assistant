// ── Custom Mode Prompt (exact user text) ──────────────────────────────────────
const ERP_CUSTOM_PROMPT = `ROLE:
You are a Senior ERP Implementation Analyst.
You need to understand processes for your client.
You have deep knowledge of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.
You help run discovery interviews for operational processes.

FOCUS AREAS (in this order):
1. Purchasing
2. Planning
3. Warehouse and logistics
4. Production
5. Sales
6. Projects
7. Returns and complaints
8. Other operational processes (not finance)

YOUR GOAL:
Understand the client's real processes — not just what they say, but how it really works.
Find: problems, documents, roles, data, exceptions, manual work, and system needs.

HOW YOU WORK:
- Always start by mapping all process areas
- Then suggest the best order for workshops
- Then go area by area
- After each area give a short summary

INTERVIEW STYLE — ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS:
- Ask exactly 2-3 short questions per turn — no more, no less
- Use B1 English only — simple words, short sentences
- Ask follow-up questions when answers are vague
- Never ask long multi-part questions
- Never focus on finance
- Stay on operational processes only

AFTER EVERY ANSWER YOU GIVE:
Write in English (B1) first — short and clear.
Then write the same in Polish directly below.
Always. No exceptions.

FOR EACH PROCESS AREA COLLECT:
- Who starts the process and when
- What document is used
- What data is needed
- What happens next
- What can go wrong
- How often it happens
- What is done manually
- What is outside the system
- What users find difficult
- What must improve in the new system
- Approvals and decisions
- Exceptions and workarounds
- Reports and KPIs needed
- Integration points
- Migration needs

My answer in English:
This process is manual and causes delays in procurement. We should document the exact steps and identify where the cross-reference breaks down. I need to know how often this causes wrong parts to be ordered.

Odpowiedź po polsku:
Ten proces jest ręczny i powoduje opóźnienia w zakupach. Powinniśmy udokumentować dokładne kroki i znaleźć gdzie odniesienie się psuje. Muszę wiedzieć jak często powoduje to zamawianie niewłaściwych części.

Pytanie 1: Jak często zdarza się ordering niewłaściwych części z powodu błędnego numeru?
Pytanie 2: Kto aktualizuje tabelę krzyżową w Excelu?
Pytanie 3: Czy dostawcy mogą bezpośrednio aktualizować swoje numery części w systemie?`,
        planning: `⚠️ Risk: Material availability not checked in real time during scheduling. 📋 Manual work: Two hours every morning updating the spreadsheet plan. 📄 Document: Weekly capacity plan printed and signed by production manager. 👤 Role: Production planner owns the planning spreadsheet.

My answer in English:
The manual spreadsheet approach creates a visibility gap. When the planner schedules a job, he cannot see if the material is actually available. This causes unscheduling and rescheduling.

Odpowiedź po polsku:
Ręczne podejście do planowania tworzy lukę w widoczności. Gdy planista tworzy harmonogram, nie może sprawdzić czy materiał jest faktycznie dostępny. Powoduje to odwoływanie i przekładanie harmonogramu.

Pytanie 1: Ile razy w tygodniu zdarza się odwołanie harmonogramu z powodu braku materiału?
Pytanie 2: Kto podejmuje decyzję o przesunięciu zadania?
Pytanie 3: Czy możemy oszacować koszt każdego odwołania?`,
        warehouse: `📋 Manual work: Paper log then ERP entry later. ⚠️ Risk: WiFi not available in warehouse — data entry delayed. 📄 Document: Delivery note compared against PO. 👤 Role: Warehouse worker receives and counts goods.

My answer in English:
The two-step process of writing first then typing later creates a data gap. During the time between receipt and ERP entry, the system shows zero inventory even though the goods are physically here.

Odpowiedź po polsku:
Dwustopniowy proces pisania najpierw a potem wpisywania tworzy lukę danych. W czasie między przyjęciem a wpisaniem do ERP system pokazuje zero stanu mimo że towary fizycznie tu są.

Pytanie 1: Ile czasu upływa średnio między przyjęciem a wpisaniem do systemu?
Pytanie 2: Czy system ERP ma funkcję tymczasowego przyjęcia?
Pytanie 3: Jak显而易见 is this inventory gap to other departments?`,
        production: `⚠️ Risk: Quality hold decisions not recorded in ERP — only in email. 📋 Manual work: Paper batch record maintained separately from ERP. 🔧 BC needs: Quality hold workflow with approval and traceability. 👤 Role: Quality manager makes hold/release decisions.

My answer in English:
The paper-based quality process means decisions are not visible in the production system. The batch record exists but it is not linked to the production order in the ERP. This makes it hard to track quality history per batch.

Odpowiedź po polsku:
Proces jakości oparty na papierze oznacza że decyzje nie są widoczne w systemie produkcyjnym. Rekord partii istnieje ale nie jest połączony z zleceniem produkcyjnym w ERP. Utrudnia to śledzenie historii jakości na partię.

Pytanie 1: Ile decyzji o wstrzymaniu zapada tygodniowo?
Pytanie 2: Czy jakości manager ma pełny obraz aktualnych wstrzymań?
Pytanie 3: Jak dokumenty jakości są archiwizowane i kiedy są niszczone?`,
        sales: `✅ BC can handle: Standard sales order workflow with price list. 📄 Document: Sales order in ERP created from customer email. 👤 Role: Sales rep creates the order. 🔧 BC needs: Customer self-service portal for order status.

My answer in English:
The manual order confirmation process means customers do not have real-time visibility into order status. The sales rep sends updates manually which is error-prone and time-consuming.

Odpowiedź po polsku:
Ręczny proces potwierdzania zamówień oznacza że klienci nie mają widoczności w czasie rzeczywistym na status zamówienia. Sprzedawca wysyła aktualizacje ręcznie co jest podatne na błędy i czasochłonne.

Pytanie 1: Ile czasu sprzedawca spędza na ręcznych aktualizacjach statusu tygodniowo?
Pytanie 2: Jak często klienci dzwonią sprawdzić status zamówienia?
Pytanie 3: Czy klienci oczekują portalu samoobsługowego?`,
        projects: `🔧 BC needs: Project cost center integration between project management tool and ERP. ⚠️ Risk: Manual timesheet entry once per week causes delayed visibility. 📄 Document: Project budget in ERP updated manually after change orders. 👤 Role: Project manager updates budget manually.

My answer in English:
The disconnected systems mean the project manager is doing double data entry. MS Project for scheduling, ERP for financials, and Excel for reporting. This creates reconciliation work and delays in forecast vs. actual tracking.

Odpowiedź po polsku:
Rozłączone systemy oznaczają że kierownik projektu robi podwójne wprowadzanie danych. MS Project dla harmonogramu, ERP dla finansów i Excel dla raportów. Tworzy to pracę nad uzgadnianiem i opóźnienia w śledzeniu prognozy vs. faktycznych.

Pytanie 1: Ile czasu tygodniowo kierownik projektu poświęca na uzgadnianie systemów?
Pytanie 2: Jak często występują rozbieżności między MS Project a ERP?
Pytanie 3: Kiedy ostatnio dane finansowe projektu były znacząco niedokładne?`,
        returns: `⚠️ Risk: No systematic complaint tracking — same complaints recur quarterly. 📋 Manual work: Excel logging by support team then forwarded by email. 🔧 BC needs: Ticket system with root cause categorization and escalation rules.

My answer in English:
The shared Excel sheet for complaint tracking does not support trend analysis. By the time the monthly meeting happens, the details are forgotten. We need to capture complaints in a structured way that enables pattern detection.

Odpowiedź po polsku:
Wspólny arkusz Excel do śledzenia reklamacji nie wspiera analizy trendów. W momencie comiesięcznego spotkania szczegóły są zapomniane. Musimy przechwytywać reklamacje w ustrukturyzowany sposób który umożliwia wykrywanie wzorców.

Pytanie 1: Ile reklamacji jest rejestrowanych miesięcznie?
Pytanie 2: Kto podejmuje decyzję o eskalacji reklamacji?
Pytanie 3: Czy mamy próbkę ostatnich reklamacji do przeanalizowania?`,
        other: `🔧 BC needs: Real-time operational KPI dashboard accessible from mobile. ⚠️ Risk: No systematic tracking of operational metrics — data compiled manually for monthly review. 📄 Document: Network drive with version-controlled Excel for ISO documentation.

My answer in English:
The lack of real-time visibility means management is always looking at historical data. By the time the monthly KPI report is ready, it is already out of date. We should identify the three most critical operational KPIs that leadership needs to see daily.

Odpowiedź po polsku:
Brak widoczności w czasie rzeczywistym oznacza że zarządzanie zawsze patrzy na dane historyczne. W momencie gdy miesięczny raport KPI jest gotowy jest już nieaktualny. Powinniśmy zidentyfikować trzy najbardziej krytyczne wskaźniki operacyjne które kierownictwo musi widzieć codziennie.

Pytanie 1: Które trzy KPI byłyby najbardziej wartościowe dla kierownictwa w czasie rzeczywistym?
Pytanie 2: Kto obecnie kompiluje comiesięczny raport operacyjny?
